<Update label="February 2025">
  ## New Configuration Schema `docs.json`

  We've introduced a new `docs.json` schema as a replacement for `mint.json`, to support better multi-level versioning, easier visual comprehension, and more consistent terminology. For more information on what's changed, [check out our blog](https://mintlify.com/blog/refactoring-mint-json-into-docs-json).&#x20;



  Upgrade from `mint.json` to `docs.json` with the following steps:

  1. Make sure your CLI is the latest version

  ```
  npm i mintlify@latest -g
  ```

  2. In your docs repository, run

  ```
  mintlify upgrade
  ```

  3. Delete your old mint.json file and push your changes

  ## CI Checks

  Automatically lint your docs to find broken links, discover spelling and grammar issues, or enforce writing styles with your own Vale config. Learn more in our [docs](settings/ci).

  ## .md support for LLMs

  All documentation pages are now automatically available as plain Markdown filesâ€”just append `.md` to the URL. This makes it easier for LLMs to ingest individual pages from your documentation.

  ## More Themes

  New pre-built themes to modify the look & feel of your docs. Configure via your [docs.json file](/settings/global).

  Now available:

  * Maple

  * Palm

  You can now ask AI to make changes to your docs, with the context of all existing documentation. Type in a prompt and the assistant will propose changes by generating a pull request.

  ## GitLab Integration Upgrade

  We've improved our support for syncing with GitLab, such as enabling automated updates and preview deployments. Check out our [docs on GitLab](/settings/gitlab) to get started.

  We've revamped our web editor so that you can now update docs with a fully WYSIWYG experience, while syncing with markdown.

  Check out our [docs on getting started with Web Editor](/web-editor).

  ## /llms.txt support

  <Frame>

  </Frame>

  All docs instances are now automatically hosted at /llms.txt and /llms-full.txt so that LLMs can easily ingest your documentation. For more information, read the [docs on the new llms.txt standard.](https://llmstxt.org)

  ## Localization

  You can now localize your docs which operates similarly to versioning. Add a `locale` to a version and fixed content in Mintlify like "Was this page helpful?" will also match the locale.

  ### Quality Improvements

  * Return chat & search results based on the current version that the user is reading

  * Authenticate users with OAuth, in addition to JWT or Shared Session tokens.

  ## Code Line Highlighting

  You can now highlight lines of code in your docs to emphasize and bring attention to important parts by adding a special comment after the language identifier. Use curly braces `{}` and specify line numbers or ranges separated by commas.

  ```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
  const greeting = "Hello, World!";
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
  sayHello();
  ```

  ````md
  ```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
  const greeting = "Hello, World!";
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
  sayHello();
  ```
  ````

  ## Light mode code blocks

  Code blocks now have a light mode variant which can be enabled by adding the following to your `mint.json`:

  ```json
  "codeBlock": {
    "mode": "auto"
  }
  ```

  ## Advanced Footer

  <Frame>
    <img src="https://d3r37wwqi2kfse.cloudfront.net/obsidian_promo-min_compressed.png" alt="Advanced Footer" />
  </Frame>

  You can now add more links to the standard footer. This upgrade
  provides more consistency between landing pages and docs, or greater customization
  if you want to spotlight specific pages like socials or status logs.

  ## Filter search based on the current user

  When personalization is enabled, search results are now filtered based on the current logged in user so that they only see the relevant content.

  ## Custom Prompts for AI Chat

  You can now customize the prompts for the AI chat. Please reach out to [support](mailto:sales@mintlify.com) if you'd like to customize the prompts.
