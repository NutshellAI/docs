## Volume Control Limitations

Due to macOS limitations with multi-output devices, changing the system volume while using <Tooltip tip="When you launch Nutshell, the application creates a virtual audio device called Nutshell Speaker. This device is essential for capturing your meeting audio and enabling real-time transcription.">Nutshell Speaker</Tooltip> may not work as expected. This is a known limitation of macOS that affects virtual audio devices.

## Using Nutshell's Built-in Volume Control

To address this limitation, we've implemented a dedicated volume control feature directly within the Nutshell desktop application.

<Steps>
  1. Open Nutshell application
  2. Locate the speaker dropdown menu in the top-right corner of the application, which contains volume controls
  3. Adjust the volume by dragging the slider left (decrease) or right (increase)
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues with volume control:

1. Ensure "Nutshell Speaker" is selected as your output device
2. Check that Nutshell is running and properly initialized
3. Try restarting the application if volume control is unresponsive

<Warning>
  If you need to use system-wide volume control, you'll need to switch back to your default audio output device.
